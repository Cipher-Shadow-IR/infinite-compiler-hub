# ♾️ Infinity Compiler Hub

Welcome to **Infinity Compiler Hub** — a futuristic, universal platform that connects developers to powerful online compilers across **300+ programming languages**. Whether you're learning, building, testing, or simply exploring, this hub is your gateway to **limitless coding**, all with the depth of a native IDE.

---

## 🚀 Vision

To create a centralized platform that:
- Redirects users to the best online compilers
- Ensures each linked compiler supports offline-IDE level features
- Covers **everything from mainstream to obscure programming languages**
- Evolves into a tool that empowers both beginners and pros across the globe

---

## 🌌 Key Features

- 🔗 **Smart Redirection**  
  Instantly links users to the best compiler available for any chosen language.

- 🧠 **Offline-IDE Level Selection Criteria**  
  Every linked compiler supports features like syntax highlighting, real-time output, file handling, and more.

- 🌍 **300+ Languages Supported**  
  From Python to Prolog, C to COBOL — we don’t stop until we’ve mapped the universe.

- 🛠️ **Continuously Evolving**  
  Languages, compilers, and tech evolve — and so do we.
